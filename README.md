# Project-Create-and-Mint-Token
This repository contains an ERC20 token contract created with Solidity and deployed using the Remix IDE. The token is based on OpenZeppelin's standard ERC20 implementation, making it a fully compliant and secure ERC20 token with minting and burning functionalities.

## Overview

The `MyErc` contract is an ERC20 token with the following features:
- **Minting**: Only the contract owner can mint new tokens.
- **Burning**: Any user holding tokens can burn (destroy) their tokens.
- **Transfer**: Tokens can be transferred between users as per the ERC20 standard.

The contract utilizes OpenZeppelin's libraries for ERC20, ERC20Burnable, and Ownable functionalities to ensure a robust and secure implementation.
