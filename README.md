# Project-Create-and-Mint-Token

This repository contains an ERC20 token contract called **Mercury** created with Solidity and deployed using the Remix IDE. The token is based on OpenZeppelin's standard ERC20 implementation, ensuring it is fully compliant and secure. It includes advanced functionalities such as minting, burning, and supply-reducing transfers.

## Features
- **Minting**: The contract owner can mint new tokens to specified accounts.
- **Burning**: Token holders can burn their tokens to reduce the total supply.
- **Transfer**: Every transfer automatically reduces the total token supply by the amount transferred.
